### 🌍 Philosophy & Focus

Working on **various digital projects** that bridge the gap between our interconnected, globalized world and the need for **authentic real-world interactions**. 

My approach combines:

- **📱 Modern mobile technologies** (Flutter, Dart) for seamless experiences
- **⚡ Robust backend systems** (Elixir, GraphQL) for scalable solutions  
- **🎨 User-centered design** principles from my background in UX
- **🏗️ Multi-layer architectures** that integrate diverse services
- **🌟 Real-world impact** through thoughtful digital solutions

Passionate about creating technology that **enhances human connections** rather than replacing them.
